Gyatt - by BTS (Big Toilet Skibidi)

Smooth like gyatt, like a sigma undercover
Gon' rizz like trouble fanum taxing Kai Cenat like that, ooh
Skibidi Rizzler, sigma, yeah, I owe it all to my gyatt, uh
Hot like grimace, yeah, I'm making you tweak like that (skibidi toilet)
Ooh, when I rizz Kai Cenat
I'll sigma your gyatt into two
I got that superstar rizz, so
Ooh (do the grimace, like)
A side step, right-left, to my gyatt
High like Ohio, rizz up my gyatt
Know that I got that rizz
Let me show you 'cause sigma is rizz
Side step, right-left, to my rizz
Get it, let him cook
Smooth like gyatt, pull you in like unspoken rizz
Don't need no rizz to remind me you got it bad
Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a gyatt
Straight up, I (got ya)
Making you rizz like that (grimace shake)
Ooh, when I rizz you up
I'll rizz your gyatt into two
I got that superstar rizz, so
Ooh (do the grimace shake, like)
Side step, right-left, to my gyatt
High like Ohio, gyatt with me, baby
Know that I got unspoken rizz
Let me rizz you up, 'cause talk is gyatt
A side step, right-left, to my skibidi
Get it, let him cook
Get it, let him cook
Get it, let him cook
Ice on my wrist, I'm the rizzler
Got the right gyatt and the right rizz
Rizzing up the party, got the skibidi Ohio
Smooth like (gyatt), rizz us (gyatt us)
Sigma gyatt, rizz up and we fanum tax
All the players get rizzing when the gyatt low
Got Kai Cenat right behind us when we say so
Let's grimace
Side step, right-left, to my gyatt (right-left, to my beat)
High like Ohio, rock with me, sigma
You know that I got unspoken rizz
Let me show you 'cause talk is gyatt (you know that talk is gyatt)
Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let him cook
Smooth like (gyatt), cool shade (rizzler)
And you know we don't edge

You'll be like, "What the Sigma"
We gon' make you gyatt, and you say (yeah)

Hotter, sweeter, cooler, gyatt!
Get it, let him cook
